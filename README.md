# OOP Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** learning repository in Python.  
This repository documents my journey in mastering OOP concepts through a combination of theory and practical projects.

---

## Purpose

The aim of this repository is to systematically learn and apply OOP principles using Python. It includes:

- Conceptual documentation of core topics
- Practical mini-projects
- Unit testing and modular design
- Continuous improvements based on feedback and exploration

## OOP Theory Notes (`/docs`)

The `docs/` directory contains structured notes and explanations of major OOP concepts, including:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Magic (Dunder) Methods

These notes are written in Markdown and are meant to complement the hands-on projects.

## Projects Overview (`/projects`)

### Student Management System

A fully implemented project that manages students, courses, instructors, and transcripts via a CLI.  
It applies multiple OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction, and includes persistence using JSON, as well as unit testing.

[Student Management System – README](https://github.com/amr-yasser226/oop-learning-repo/tree/main/projects/student_management#readme)

### Banking System

Currently under development. This project will simulate a simple banking environment with the following goals:

- Account creation and management
- Deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfers
- Use of OOP for account types and transactions

### Library Management

Also under development. Planned features include:

- Book catalog and availability tracking
- User registration and roles
- Borrowing and returning mechanisms
- OOP-driven interactions between users and books

## Learning Approach

This repository serves as both a learning archive and a demonstration of clean, modular, and object-oriented Python code. It emphasizes:

- Writing reusable and maintainable code
- Understanding the theoretical foundation of OOP
- Applying principles in practical, testable projects

---

## Setup

Each project is self-contained and includes its own setup instructions. For example, to run the student management system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amr-yasser226/oop-learning-repo.git
cd oop-learning-repo/projects/student_management
````

Use a virtual environment and install any necessary dependencies as defined in `pyproject.toml` or project-specific guides.

---

## Roadmap

* Complete the core features of the banking system
* Implement functionality for library management
* Add command-line interfaces for remaining projects
* Expand documentation with examples and diagrams
