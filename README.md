# OOP Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP)** learning repository.  
This repository contains both Python and C++ implementations of OOP concepts, organized into theory notes and practical projects.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to systematically learn and apply OOP principles in two languages:

- **Python**: conceptual documentation, mini‑projects, unit testing  
- **C++**: modern C++17 projects with layered architecture and API integration

## Contents

### C++

- **Library Management System**  
  - Console‑based application built with C++17  
  - Uses CMake, vcpkg, SQLite, and the Open Library API  
- **Documentation**  
  - Architecture overview  
  - Class diagrams and design patterns  
  - Data flow and module descriptions  

### Python

- **OOP Theory Notes** (`Python/docs/`)  
  - Coverage of core topics: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, dunder methods  
- **Projects** (`Python/projects/`)  
  - Student Management System (complete)  
  - Banking System (under development)  
  - Library Management (under development)  
- **Testing**  
  - Unit tests and interactive test modules for each project  

---

## Learning Approach

- Maintain a clear separation between theory (`docs/`) and implementation (`projects/`)  
- Emphasize reusable, modular, and maintainable code  
- Apply OOP principles in both Python and C++ projects  

---

## Setup

Each language directory is self‑contained. Follow the instructions in each project’s README.

**Example: Python Student Management**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amr-yasser226/oop-learning-repo.git
cd oop-learning-repo/Python/projects/student_management
# Create virtual environment, install dependencies, and run
````

**Example: C++ Library Management**

```bash
cd oop-learning-repo/C++/LibraryManagement
# Install dependencies via vcpkg, configure with CMake, and build
```

---

## Roadmap

* Complete Python Banking and Library projects
* Expand documentation for C++ modules and design patterns
* Add new projects and explore additional OOP concepts
