# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together. OOP models real‚Äêworld entities as objects; each object is an instance of a class.

## Core Concepts of OOP

1. ### Class
   A **class** serves as a blueprint or template that defines:
   - **Attributes** (data/state)
   - **Methods** (functions/behavior)

2. ### Object (Instance)
   An **object** (or instance) is a concrete instantiation of a class.  
   When you call a class in Python:
   1. Memory is allocated to store its attributes.  
   2. You receive an object that you can manipulate via its methods and attributes.

3. ### Encapsulation

## Why OOP Matters in Python

- **Multi-Paradigm Nature**  
  Python supports multiple paradigms, and OOP is central to its design.

- **Built-in Types Are Classes**  
  Every built-in type (e.g., `str`, `list`, `dict`) is implemented as a class.

- **Library and Framework Integration**  
  - Many standard library modules expose class-based interfaces.  
  - Popular frameworks (e.g., Flask) and ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) expect you to define models as classes.

- **Maintainability**  
  Organizing code into classes and objects keeps large codebases modular, readable, and easier to maintain.
