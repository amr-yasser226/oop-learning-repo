# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together. OOP models real‚Äêworld entities as objects; each object is an instance of a class.

## Core Concepts of OOP

1. ### Class

   A **class** serves as a blueprint or template that defines:

   * **Attributes** (data/state) declared as member variables
   * **Methods** (functions/behavior) declared as member functions

2. ### Object (Instance)

   An **object** (or instance) is a concrete instantiation of a class.
   When you instantiate a class in C++:

   1. The constructor initializes member variables.
   2. Memory is allocated either on the stack or heap (with `new`).

3. ### Encapsulation

4. ### Inheritance

5. ### Polymorphism

6. ### Abstraction

## Why OOP Matters in C++

* **Performance and Control**
  C++ allows fine-grained control over memory and execution, while leveraging OOP design principles.

* **Standard Library and Templates**
  The Standard Template Library (STL) uses class templates (`std::vector`, `std::string`, etc.) extensively.

* **Resource Management (RAII)**
  Classes encapsulate acquisition and release of resources in constructors and destructors.

* **Framework and Engine Development**
  Many game engines, GUI frameworks, and high-performance systems are built with C++ OOP.

* **Maintainability**
  Structuring code into classes and objects keeps large C++ codebases modular and easier to extend.
